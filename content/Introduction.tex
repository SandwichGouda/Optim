\chapter*{Introduction}
\pagestyle{fancy}

Throughout the years, I have learnt to learn. 

One of the strongest conclusion that I came up to is that the best way (for me) to learn, is to write down things that I have understood, clearly, with my words, in the way that I have done here in this document. This enables good understanding, memorizing, and to ensure thorough study of the state of the art, whatever topic I am deep diving into.

Besides ensuring a great understanding of notions, this document also provides proof to anyone as to how determined, passionate and committed I can be.

During this gap year, I have, although not as much as theoretically possible, more time than ever to perform such deep and thorough diving. Last year, R. A. Dragomir and  O. Fercoq's lectures on optimization made me go nuts, and I have likely decided that this branch of mathematics will be the one I ought to dedicate my life to.

I am excited to start my journey by building the strong foundations laid out in this document

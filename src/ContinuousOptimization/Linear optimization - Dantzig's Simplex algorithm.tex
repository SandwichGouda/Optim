We now describe the classical algorithm to solve linear programming problems, namely, Dantzig's simplex algorithm, often referred to as the Simplex algorithm.

We must first provide some definition. Consider a linear optimization problem in standard form :



Kamakar's method exists. Brief overview


The simplex's name is not on a simplex

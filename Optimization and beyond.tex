Throughout the years, I have learnt how to learn. And in particular, one of the strongest conclusion that I came up to is that the best way (for me) to learn, is to write down things that I have understood, clearly, with my words. Whence the idea of this report. 

This document also shows how deeply motivated I am towards the topics that are presented here.
